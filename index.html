      <h2>About me!</h2>
      <p>I'm an <strong>aspiring programmer</strong> with over <em>ten years</em> of self taught knowledge.
      I wish to become a <em>career programmer</em> and help shape the future of technology.
      I am also an aspiring <strong>independent game developer</strong> with knowledge of <em>artificial
      intelligence</em>, game events, and trigger scripting using <strong>JavaScript</strong>.  I have the
      ability to learn and adapt at a very rapid pace, allowing me to keep up with
      current <em>trends</em> and <em>technologies</em>.

      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>I have taught myself how to use many different <strong>programming languages</strong> from
      Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, XML, and a few other easy languages.
      Some of my experiece ranges from <em>web development</em>, <em>game development</em>, and <em>defensive security</em>.
      One thing I enjoy doing is building website templates for friends, family, and <abbr title="Non Profit Organizations">NPOs</abbr>.</p>

      <h2>Why I decided to learn programming</h2>
      <p>I decided to learn programming because I enjoy watching text turn into something <strong>much more</strong> than just text.
      I enjoy bringing <em>life</em> to ideas, and watching them grow into <strong><em>something magnificent</em></strong>.
      Since I first started learning Python thirteen years ago, I have watched many ideas come to life, and I have helped other bring life to their ideas.</p>
